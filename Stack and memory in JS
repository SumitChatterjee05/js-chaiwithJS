We have 2 types of memory in JS: Stack and Heap.
Stack is used for primitive datatypes while Heap is used for non-primitive datatypes.
In stack we get a copy of the variable decleared whereas in heap we get refernece of the data stored in the variable decleared.
So changes will occur on the copy in stack while in the oriiginla in case of heap.
